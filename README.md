ledger stats is a simple browser-based frontend for ledger, a double-entry
accounting system with a command-line reporting interface.

## Requirements

- A web server with [PHP](http://php.net) 5.3.0+ installed
- [ledger](https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger) 3.0.0 (may work with older versions)

## Installation

Simply place the `ledger-stats` directory in a publicly accessible location
within your web server's document root and access the `index.php` file it 
contains.

## Configuration

`config.php` contains a default set of configuration settings that can be
modified to suit your preferences. Each setting is documented to indicate the
purpose of its value. In particular, the `file` setting must be set to the 
path of a data file in the ledger format that ledger stats will query. 

## Usage

Optionally enter in a beginning or ending date or amount or one or more
accounts to include or exclude. If no accounts are specified, all accounts are
included by default. To exclude an account, prefix an account name with a
hyphen (`-`). Begin typing a portion of an account name to have it
autocomplete. When you've entered all desired criteria, submit the form to see
visualizations of the data provided by plugins.

## Plugins

ledger stats provides the ability to filter transactions by account, date,
and amount. It then passes the filtered transactions to plugins, files in
the `plugins` directory that return a closure to execute. These closures are
executed in line to display whatever output they will. They have access to
the jQuery and Highcharts libraries. See the bundled files in the `plugins`
directory for examples.

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com) 1.6.2
